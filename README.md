## Model details
**CD7 bottle seal** ![Download](https://github.com/BrentonCavanagh/MicroscopySTL/blob/main/CD7%20BOTTLE%20Simple%20Seal.stl)

Designed to fit the humidifier bottle on a Zeiss Celldiscoverer 7.  This was required after noticing condensation was leaking from where the bottle and lid made came in contact after 2 years of use.  This polyurathane seal prevents the leak.

It was printed at 0.1mm resolution with Ultimaker TPU95a filament.
